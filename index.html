            <h2>A timeline of Dunant's life</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>8 May 1828 - Born in Geneva, Switzerland</li>
                <li>1856 - Starts a company in Algeria, then a French colony, but gets into into disputes 
                over land and water rights with the colonial government.</li>
                <li>24 June 1859 - Arrives in Solferino hoping to appeal the colonial government's decision 
                to French Emperor Napoleon III. He arrives after a battle between the French and the 
                Austrian armies and is shocked by the lack of medical attention given to the wounded 
                soldiers there. He mobilizes the civilians in the area to care for the soldiers. When 
                there proved to be an absence of suitable resources for treating the soldiers, Dunant 
                arranged for the purchase of those resources. He encouraged the civilians to treat the 
                soldiers regardless of what side they were on. He also got Austrian doctors captured by 
                the French to be released.</li>
                <li>1862 - Publishes, at his own expense, a book called <cite>Un Souvenir de 
                Solferino</cite> (<cite>A Memory of Solferino</cite>). The book puts forward the idea 
                that there should be a neutral organization that treats wounded soldiers. 1600 copies 
                of the book are printed, and Dunant distributes them to politicians and military 
                leaders throughout Europe.</li>
                <li>9 February 1863 - The Geneva Society for Public Welfare holds a meeting where it 
                discusses and approves of Dunant's ideas for a medical organization that treats 
                soldiers. It then creates a five-person committee to accomplish these ideas. Dunant 
                is made one of the five members.</li>
                <li>17 February 1863 - The committee meets for the first time. This is now considered 
                the founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Tensions quickly arise 
                between Dunant and another one of the committee's members, Gustave Moynier, the 
                President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, as Moynier considers Dunant's 
                objectives to be unrealistic.</li>
                <li>October 1863 - Dunant directs protocol during a meeting of 14 states that is 
                organized by the committee and that discusses how care provided to injured soldiers 
                may be improved.</li>
                <li>22 August 1864 - Dunant organizes accommodations for the guests at a diplomatic 
                conference that leads to 12 states signing the First Geneva Convention.</li>
                <li>Late 1860s - 1890s - Dunant suffers a variety of misfortunes that primarily involve his 
                failing businesses and loses financial support from his relatives and friends. He loses 
                his place on the committee and leaves Geneva, living in poverty and frequently moving 
                from city to city in Europe. Eventually, in 1887, he begins receiving financial support 
                from a distant relative, which allows him to settle down in the Swiss village of Heiden, 
                where he will live until his death. From 30 April 1892 onwards, he lives in a nursing 
                home in the village. He meets a young teacher called Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife 
                Susanna, who starts a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden, making Dunant the honorary 
                president of this branch.</li>
                <li>September 1895 - Georg Baumberger publishes the article 
                "<cite id="dunant-article">Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross</cite>," 
                which quickly spreads to many other European newspapers, and Dunant again gains 
                the recognition and support of the public. He is awarded the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize 
                and gets a note from Pope Leo XIII. He starts receiving financial donations, 
                which improves his financial circumstances considerably.</li>
                <li>1897 - Rudolf MÃ¼ller writes a version of the history of the Red Cross that highlights 
                Dunant's role much than other histories at that time. This book includes the text of 
                <cite>A Memory of Solferino</cite>.</li>
                <li>1901 - Dunant receives the first Nobel Peace Prize for his work in founding the Red 
                Cross and helping to bring about the Geneva Convention. The congratulations that he 
                receives from the International Committee of the Red Cross reads:
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant">"There is no man who more 
                deserves this honour, for it was you, forty years ago, who set on foot the international 
                organization for the relief of the wounded on the battlefield. Without you, the Red 
                Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably 
                have never been undertaken."</blockquote></li>
                <li>1901 - 1910 - Dunant receives a variety of accolades. He continues to live in the 
                nursing home in Heiden until his death, with his last years marred by depression 
                and paranoia about his creditors and Moynier coming after him.</li>
                <li>30 October 1910 - Dunant dies aged 82. His final words are, <q>Where has humanity 
                gone?</q></li>
